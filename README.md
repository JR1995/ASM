# ASM
Active Set Method (ASM) used to solve Quadratic Programming (QP) problems in MPC.
Including a primal ASM algorithm and a dual ASM algorithm.
We are also trying to use two strategies to accelerate ASM for MPC. The strategies are:
1) Weighted Gram-Schmidt method to update QR factorization in ASM.
2) Constraints Selection method to reduce iteration count in ASM.
